# Swap Numbers Without Third Variable - Java Program

This is a Java program that allows the user to swap the values of two numbers without using a third variable. The program takes user input for two numbers and then demonstrates how to swap their values using arithmetic operations.

## How It Works

The program follows these steps to swap two numbers without using a third variable:
1. It prompts the user to enter the first number.
2. It prompts the user to enter the second number.
3. The program then performs the swap operation using arithmetic operations:
   - The first number (`num1`) is updated to the sum of the two numbers (`num1 = num1 + num2`).
   - The second number (`num2`) is updated to the difference between the updated `num1` and the original `num2` (`num2 = num1 - num2`).
   - Finally, the updated `num1` is calculated as the difference between the original `num1` and the updated `num2` (`num1 = num1 - num2`).
4. The program displays the values of the two numbers before and after the swap.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java code using the Java compiler (typically `javac`):

   ```bash
   javac SwapNumbers.java
