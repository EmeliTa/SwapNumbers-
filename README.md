# Swap Numbers Without Third Variable - Java Program

This is a Java program that allows the user to swap the values of two numbers without using a third variable. The program takes user input for two numbers and then demonstrates how to swap their values using arithmetic operations.

## How It Works

The program follows these steps to swap two numbers without using a third variable:
1. It prompts the user to enter the first number.
2. It prompts the user to enter the second number.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java code using the Java compiler (typically `javac`):

   ```bash
   javac SwapNumbers.java
